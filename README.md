Created for Ludum Dare 51 Compo. 

### Description:
Unfortunately I was not able to spend the full 48hrs for the compo. I had only 6 hrs and pretty happy with the way it turned out. Very fun to go back to basics

First time using Raylib but have used SFML/SDL in the past. It's a very nice library :)
